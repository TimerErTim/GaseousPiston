# 3D-Printed LiquidPiston (GaseousPiston)

---

This design uses a compressor with an air pressure of 8 bar. It is meant to be
3D-Printed and **does not** require low tolerances. It is easy to assemble.

### Notes

- Even though model dimensions are unitless, it is designed to use mm. So a rotor with
  the radius of 10 is meant to be 20mm wide.
